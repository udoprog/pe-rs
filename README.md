# Rust stdlib-only solutions to Project Euler

**Spoiler Warning:** I'm publishing these here since I find it really interesting reading through
other solutions on Github, and want to provide these as a source for others to look through if they
want to. I've also previously solved a number of PE exercises, and attempting to keep the solutions
private lead to them being lost after a longer period of time.

To avoid accidental spoilers the results are hashed. This is by no means bulletproof. But if you
take the time to figure out how to show the result I suspect it's what you want anyways.
